Self-stabilization on Graph-theoretic Structures: Implementation and Analysis of a Probabilistic Fault Containment Algorithm
---
This paper introduces a probabilistic fault containment algorithm which utilizes the techniques of self-stabilization to solve specific instances of the fault recovery problem. Along with a formal introduction to the algorithm and the self-stabilization paradigm, we will present an implementation scheme in C++ and discuss several observations of the empirical performance of the algorithm on various system configurations and fault-counts.

The goal of this paper is to determine which, if any, graph-theoretic structures favor a probabilistic approach to fault containment. We will be specifically interested in investigating the relative performance of the fault containment algorithm on lists, trees, and various network structures including ring, and mesh topologies.
